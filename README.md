Analyze Countrywide Traffic Accidents in the US from 2016 to 2021  


# Plan 
In this project, we will be exploring Countrywide Traffic Accidents in the US from 2016 to 2021. First, we will fetch the data to our local SQL database, and clean the data primarily with R. We will be conducting statistical inference on characteristics that demonstrates correlation with different types of accidents. Next, we will analyze the data through analytical tools and visualization techniques to hypothesize causality. Finally, we intend to develop a prediction model that ascertain our hypothesis. We hope that the outcome of the project provides insight on road safety.
