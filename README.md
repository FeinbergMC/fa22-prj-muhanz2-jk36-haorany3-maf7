The website has conducted basic statistical inferences, but it did not conduct a rigorous data analysis. For example, the website only aggregated all variables regarding freedom and all variables regarding prosperity, but it did not specifically look at each of the subcategories regarding freedom and prosperity. In addition, the measure of freedom was not holistic. For example, in terms of economic freedom, only income was being scored, but important factors such as GDP per capita was not calculated. Prompted by the inadequacies of this report, our group want to take a step forward by further look analyze how different freedom is correlated to different aspects of prosperity. 

# Plan
Our general plan is to look at how categories of freedom and prosperity is correlated with each other(visualization, covariance, correlation). Next, based on these calculations, we want to build a decision tree model predicting the level of prosperity based on freedom.
