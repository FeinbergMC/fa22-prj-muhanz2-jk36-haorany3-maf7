## Exploratory Analysis - Descriptive Statistics

### Overview

Our project is based around analysis of the Freedom and Prosperity dataset from the Atlantic Council Freedom and Prosperity Center. This dataset has detailed data on 174 countries of the world, split into 6 geographical regions. The regions, along with their abbreviations, are listed below. We will be using these abbreviations throughout our project reports.

- America: **AME** (32 countries)
- Asia Pacific: **AP** (28 countries)
- Europe and Central Asia: **ECA** (18 countries)
- Middle Eastern Asia: **MENA** (18 countries)
- Sub Saharan Africa: **SSA** (47 countries)
- Western Europe: **WE/EU** (31 countries)

All data points in our dataset were recorded multiple times over a 15 year period - during 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021.

The data covers freedom and prosperity, with detailed categories for each to give further insight into specifics of each country's freedom and prosperity conditions. The freedom data is split into three categories:

- **Economic Freedom** (4 additional subcategories)
- **Political Freedom** (3 additional subcategories)
- **Legal Freedom** (10 additional subcategories)

The prosperity data is split into five categories:

- **Income**
- **Environment**
- **Minority Rights**
- **Health**
- **Happiness**

Values for the overall categories were calculated by taking the average of all individual subcategory values.

### Initial Analysis

We start by analyzing the overall scores for freedom and prosperity. Descriptive statistics for each variable is shown in the table below:

![](img/maf7/initialdescriptive.png){width=100%}

Here is a graph displaying scores for each country, colored by region. This coloring will stay consistent throughout the initial descriptive data analysis.

### Freedom Score Analysis

We can analyze the freedom scores for each specific region. Descriptive statistics for freedom score grouped by country region is shown in the table below:

![](img/maf7/freedomdescriptive.png){width=100%}

We can also use a box plot to visually see the freedom scores grouped by region.

![](img/maf7/freedomscores.png){width=100%}

Our dataset has an additional categorical variable for freedom scores. The categorical variable is assigned as follows:

- **Unfree (UF)**: freedom score from 0 to 25
- **Mostly Unfree (MUF)**: freedom score from 25 to 50
- **Mostly Free (MF)**: freedom score from 50 to 75
- **Free (F)**: freedom score from 75 to 100

We can use this categorical variable to generate an additional visualization for country freedom. These bar plots are shown below.

### Freedom Category Score Analysis

We can now look into the three categories for the freedom score (as a reminder, these three category scores are averaged to generate the overall freedom score for each country.) Below are the descriptive statistics and the accompanying box plots for each freedom category.

#### Economic Freedom Scores Descriptive Statistics

#### Political Freedom Scores Descriptive Statistics

#### Legal Freedom Scores Descriptive Statistics

The subcategories for each freedom category will be investigated later in the project.


### Prosperity Score Analysis

Similarly to what we have just done for the freedom scores, we can analyze the prosperity scores by region. Descriptive stats for the prosperity score grouped by region are shown below.

![](img/maf7/prosperitydescriptive.png){width=100%}

We can also use a box plot to visually see the prosperity scores grouped by region.

![](img/maf7/prosperityscores.png){width=100%}

Similarly to the freedom scores, our dataset has an additional categorical variable for prosperity scores. The categorical variable is assigned as follows:

- **Unprosperous (UP)**: prosperity score from 0 to 25
- **Mostly Unprosperous (MUP)**: prosperity score from 25 to 50
- **Mostly Prosperous (MP)**: prosperity score from 50 to 75
- **Prosperous (P)**: prosperity score from 75 to 100

We can use this categorical variable to generate an additional visualization for country prosperity. These bar plots are shown below.

![](img/maf7/prosperitycategorical.png){width=100%}

### Prosperity Category Score Analysis

We can now look into the five categories for the prosperity score (as a reminder, these five category scores are averaged to generate the overall prosperity score for each country.) Below are the descriptive statistics and the accompanying box plots for each prosperity category.

#### Income Scores Descriptive Statistics

#### Minority Rights Scores Descriptive Statistics

*Note: there are 6 N/A values for Minority Rights prosperity scores in the dataset. These countries were ignored during the below analysis.*

#### Happiness Scores Descriptive Statistics

## Exploratory Analysis - Correlations 

We will investigate the correlations between the main categories of Freedom and Prosperity against their subcategories. Next, we will dive into the specific factors of Freedom and obtain the factors that have are highly correlated with the subcategories of Freedom.

## Freedom and its Main Categories

## Statistical Learning Methods

For the following slides, we will be looking at various statistical models that will help with this data analysis project.

## Linear Regression - General Scores

![Linear Regression](https://github.com/illinois-stat447/fa22-prj-muhanz2-jk36-haorany3-maf7/blob/main/img/freedomvprosperity.png?raw=true){width=60%}

From this plot we can infer that there seems to be an upward curve resembling an exponential relationship. As there seems to be two large clusters, we will attempt to cluster the groups using Gaussian Mixture Model method.

## Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering

We can see from the clusters above that there are two clustered groups between the free and prosporous countries against the unfree and unprosperous countries.

## Statistical Learning with Trees

We use several supervised learning methods to build prediction models for prosperity scores based on all the freedom subcategories, and compare their performances. 

## Data Processing and prediction settings 
Our data source is from the Atlantic Council. For every country starting from 2006 and in every 5 years, the Atlantic give it a score for every freedom subcategories and prosperity. Using these scores, we form the training and testing data set. Since the algorithmic models we intend to use are designed for predicting discrete values, we have to classify the propserity socres into resonable partitions.In achieving this, the following basic statistical inferneces are made:

| mean | median | maximum | minimum | standard deviation| 
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 48.38 | 50.57 | 98.63 | 15.47 | 19.05 |

The following is the visualization of distribution of prosperity scores amongst all data.

## Time Series Data Analysis with Raw Data

Understanding what variables are important according the correlations of the normalized scores, we will check the current situation of some countries and investigate if the raw data aligns with our findings from the scored dataset.
